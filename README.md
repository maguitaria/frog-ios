# 🐸 Angry Frog (iOS)

A playful, synchronized noise-making app where frogs scream in unison across devices. This is the iOS counterpart to our original [Android version](https://git-iit.fh-joanneum.at/nowotnyt19/angry-frog) — same chaos, new platform.

## 📱 What It Does

- Tap the screen  
  → The frog image changes  
  → A scream sound plays

- At the same time…  
  → Every **other device** with the app also screams!

It’s a fun, harmless concept pretending to use **Bluetooth, WLAN, and location data** to find and trigger nearby frogs — all connected through a backend.

---

## 🔧 How It Works

The app simulates:
- Nearby device discovery (via fake permissions)
- Sound/image triggering across devices
- A central backend to coordinate scream events

Backend communication is lightweight and could be expanded, but for now, it’s all about the *illusion* of smart tech behind very silly frogs.

## 🍏 iOS Version Notes

- Built with Swift / SwiftUI (or UIKit if applicable)
- Same visual and audio assets as Android
- Goal: parity with Android functionality
- Bonus plan: **Apple Watch support** — tap your wrist, make frogs scream 🎉

## 🔗 Android Version

Our original Android app repo is available [here](https://git-iit.fh-joanneum.at/nowotnyt19/angry-frog) (private repo – ask Arthur for access).

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This app is intentionally **not** sophisticated. It’s silly, fun, and meant to make people laugh — especially when multiple devices start screaming together.

No real location or Bluetooth data is used — just good old-fashioned frog-powered chaos.

---

## 🧪 Future Ideas

- Real device sync (Multipeer Connectivity, local network)
- Web dashboard of frog activity
- Cross-platform Apple Watch support
- More frog personalities (screaming duck collab incoming?)
